# Kemitix Trello

Wrapper for Trello.

This wraps the `com.taskadapter:trello-java-wrapper` library.

It is intended for use on my `slushy` and `fuller` projects. It was originally developed as part of `slushy` and was extracted when preparing to start on `fuller` which would need some of the same functionality.

Requires JDK 11+
